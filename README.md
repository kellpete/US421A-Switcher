# US421A-Switcher

This is a simple Windows command line utility to control an Aten US421A 4 Port Peripheral Switch.

## Purpose

The tool was written to control the peripheral switch from scripts. 
Depending on your needs, it may also serve as a lightweight replacement of Aten's GUI tool (Peripheral Switch Utility). 

## Download

Get the [latest release](https://github.com/kellpete/US421A-Switcher/releases/latest) from github

## Usage

Execute it with no arguments to switch to the host that executes it.

For some more options and explanations, run 

    US421A-Switcher --help 

## Supported devices

I only tested on a US421A device, but maybe it also works on a US221A (the 2 port version), or even on the USB3 versions. Please let me know if you tested it with any other device - successfully or not - so I can list it here

## Feedback

Any kind of feedback is welcome (bugs, feature requests, or just a note that it is useful to you...)
